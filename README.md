MUSIC V 2009 code
=================

This is Max Mathew's MUSIC V synthesis program, prepared by
Bill Schottstaed for gfortran, with further additions and fixes by
Victor Lazzarini, as released in 2009. 

This code has lots of bugs and issues that had not been fixed at
the time and is only kept here as an archive of the restoration
process. 

The latest fully restored code is held in the master branch.
